#Monday

Today I tidied up a lot of the geneMANIA stuff I did last week. It seems that there are some genes that more consistently come up as coexpressed with the pathways than others. Namely, ACTN1, CST3, ANXA1, PPP2CA, PPP2CB, SPARC, BGN, DCN, and PLOD2. ANXA1 is typically associated with inflammatory responses, ACTN1 and SPARC with platelet activation, SPARC, DCN, CST3, BGN, ACTN1 & PLOD2 with extracellular matrix organisation, and PPP2CA and PPP2CB with fibroblast growth receptor activation (though whether this has anything to do with neurodegeneration I don't know).

Platelet activation has been recently implicated in neurodegeneration (Mazereeuw et al. 2013, "Platelet activating factors in depression and coronary artery disease: A potential biomarker related to inflammatory mechanisms and neurodegeneration")

I looked this afternoon at comparing the DEG enriched pathways and the pathprint pathways. This was not easy as GeneMANIA uses GO terms whereas pathprint uses KEGG, Wikipathways etc. I had to try and find equivalents of the GO pathways in the Pathprint database, which I think is super sketchy but I didn't have a choice. To be honest, I'm just trying to get somthing interesting for the presentation so it doesn't have to be groundbreaking. It was interesting though - I could only find a pathway related to the dermatan/chondroitin metabolism, but when I correlated that with the pathprint pathways I ended up with metabolic pathways being negatively correlated, and immunity/inflammation pathways positively correlated.

#Tuesday

I worked a little on the presentation today, still trying to cut it down as it's far too long. In the mean time John had sent me some different GWAS lists, which tightened the thresholds of significance (and therefore lost me some genes). I also went through GWAS catalog and looked to see if there were any on there, and I found that there were some in there that had been reported. So overall:

**GWAS central (ALS)**
CSRP1 (0.0006729)   
RAB40B (0.0005151)   
SERBP1 (0.0008722)   
TUG1 (0.0006935)   

**GWAS catalog**
PFDN1 (Alzheimer's Disease, 3x10-7)   
ZFYVE26 (ALS, 6x10-7)   

Note that TUG1 is a non-protein-coding gene so is often missed. For full details on the SNPs, go to the file ALLDEGs.xlsx

#Wednesday
Today I looked at extending my gene list to see if there are any SNP-containing genes associated with my seed list. I generated a list of 95 by including 50 more genes by genemania (co-expression, genetic interaction, physical interaction, weighting based on biological processes)

This was the output:
TUG1
NDUFS5
PLEKHB1
BBIP1
DCN
RPL35A
RAB40B
VPS13B
JAG1
KPNA6
MPHOSPH9
NKTR
ZNF518A
ZFYVE26
CDH11
PTPN13
PPP1R7
STMN1
SERBP1
POGZ
PFDN1
SCN1B
CST3
BPTF
CREG1
RPL37
PLOD2
OTUB1
BGN
CSRP1
NUTF2
ANXA1
TCF4
MXI1

PPP2R1B
S100A11
RNPS1

From this I identified 4 more SNPS

COL14A1 (ALS)
COL3A1 (AD and Lewy body dementia)
CTNNB1 (ALS)
LRCC7 (ALS)

I tried using GWAS central myself but it's horrible to navigate. John says that they don't allow large amounts of information to be downloaded, and when he tried to contact them about AD SNPs they basically said no because of collaboration/authorship problems.

I did a little investigation of the DCN/BGN story as I had been emphasising it in my presentation. I decided to input just DCN and BGN in genemania and ask for the 20 most related genes. This contained 4 GWAScentral SNPs, including APP.

As it turned out, of these 6 genes, 5 were enriched for extracellular matrix organisation, but not dermatan/chondroitin metabolism.
